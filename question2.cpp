// Question 2. Linked Lists
// Given there is a singly linked lists that may or may not have circularity. This implies that the direction of the node 
//from the list may be pointing towards a node previous to it, or itself. Please provide a function that checks for circularity 
// given the following restrictions: the minimum amount of storage should be used, and consider the number of elements in the 
// list is very large. 

// Notes about solution:
// Given around 1 to 2 variables should be used as storage uniquely.
